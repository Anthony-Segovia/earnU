# earnU

The system has three components, a DAO consisting of local tech companies, a program curriculum, and students. Local tech companies are minting NFT to be in a DAO. DAO creates a track and curriculum for their needs. Students are attending online classes; after each lesson and course, they earn Miami Coin, and after all programs, they enter the exam to test their knowledge and experience, if they pass the exam, they get an NFT Certificate of Achievement and the right to get an interview directly from the local tech companies.
